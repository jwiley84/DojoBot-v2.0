## DojoHelperBot version 2.0

(Kept separate from version 1 for reasons)

Uses LUIS, QnAMaker, Rich Cards, FormFlow frameworks.

DojoHelperBot was designed as way to give back to the school that taught me to code. It takes questions from non-standard students such as international students and veterans and assists to the best of it's ability.
